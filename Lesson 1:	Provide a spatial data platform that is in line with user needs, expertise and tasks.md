### Lesson 1: Provide a spatial data platform that is in line with user needs, expertise and tasks

A spatial data publication platform is an online platform which different users enables to publish, view or edit spatial data. To make the platform succesfull and widely supported, the platform must meet user’s needs and be adapted to user’s expertise and tasks.

#####Why?

Because different users:

1.	need different information,

    _for example a user who is interested in locations of bicycle stands, does not need a map with both bicycle stands and trees on it_.
2.	have different expertise 
    _for example GIS-experts have more experience in editing topographic objects in a map, then a non-GIS-user._ 
3.	have different tasks, qualifications and responsibilities, 
    _for example sensitive information from a public data set is not available to ordinary users._ 
4.	speak different languages, 
    _for example the formal designation ‘greening’ for the maintainer of the public green spaces, while   ordinary people will look for ‘park’._

#####Intended outcome

A platform that adapts the data and features to the user.


#####Possible approach
User centred design of the platform applies: extensive attention should be given to needs, wants and limitations of the end-user. The platform has to be kept as simple as possible, in order to make it approachable for expert and non-expert owners and users of spatial data.

These features increase the ease of use and intended use:

1. Ensure good search functionality, 
_for example let users search for whole datasets or single objects based on space, time and theme (keyword or category)._
2. Hide specialists functions for non-expert users, 
_for example do not give ordinary users not the option to perform coordinate transformation._
3. Grant privileges and roles to users (aka _user management_), _for example work with a base layer and an edit layer, whereby the owner of the dataset (who is responsible for the correctness of the data) can commit changes made by an ordinary user from the edit layer to the base layer._
4. Translate the termonoligy of the data into the language of the user, 
_for example, create a link table to convert from formal designation 'greening' to plain language 'park'._
